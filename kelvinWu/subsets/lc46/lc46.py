# Problem Statement #

# Given a set of distinct numbers, find all of its permutations.

# Permutation is defined as the re-arranging of the elements of the set. For example, {1, 2, 3} has the following six permutations:

# {1, 2, 3}
# {1, 3, 2}
# {2, 1, 3}
# {2, 3, 1}
# {3, 1, 2}
# {3, 2, 1}

# If a set has ‘n’ distinct elements it will have n!n! permutations.

def find_permutations(nums):
  result = []
  # TODO: Write your code here
  return result


def main():
  print("Here are all the permutations: " + str(find_permutations([1, 3, 5])))


main()
