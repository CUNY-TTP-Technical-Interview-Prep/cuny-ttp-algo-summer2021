## Course Overview

We will categorize coding interview problems into a set of 16 patterns. Each pattern will be a complete tool - consisting of data structures, algorithms, and analysis techniques. These tools will enable you to solve a specific category of problems. The goal is to develop an understanding of the underlying pattern, so that, we can apply that pattern to solve other problems.

Each problem not only maps to the same pattern but also presents different constraints. Overall, the course has around 125+ problems of varying difficulties. The problems solved under these patterns use a varied set of algorithmic techniques.

We will start with a brief introduction of each pattern before jumping into the problems. Under each pattern, the first problem will explain the underlying pattern in detail to build the concepts that can be applied to later problems. The later problems will focus on the different constraints each problem presents and how our algorithm needs to change to handle them.

## Assignments

- For any assignment where we ask you to solve a problem(s) or conduct mock technical interviews in class, please work in a code editor of choice and submit your work to github periodically throughout the day with descriptive comments
- The `assignments` folder is where you find the assigned classwork & homework for each day. Assignments are broken down into 1 of 16 patterns, furthermore, you will find subfolders with the week and day designation (\*for example w1d1 stands for "week 1 day 1")

## Submitting Work

1. To get setup to submit homework & classwork, **fork & clone this repository**.
2. Pull from the **cuny-ttp-algo-summer2021** repository into your fork often as files will be updated 2-3 times per week.
3. When you are ready to start comitting work to your fork, create a new folder with your name in camelCase (\*example: christopherLinares) and copy the "assignments" folder and "README" file into your new folder. You can submit your solutions as Javascript, C++ OR Python files. Please don't change the base name of the file.
4. Please double check to ensure that you did **NOT** "cut & paste" these files, but, instead made fresh copies into the folder with your name
5. Please always make sure that you are working in your folder and not a classmates
6. Please attempt to commit early and commit often
7. We will strive for creating at minimum one PR to the CUNY-TTP-Technical-Interview-Prep Org on Github per day
8. Be vigilent of feedback/comments/change requests/etc on GitHub. Github is just as important as checking slack or email threads...

## Homework

### Expectations

- You will complete all algos listed in the syllabus on a weekly basis.
- We will review your comments/high level overview & code to identify strengths and weaknesses within your understanding of each pattern.
- You will NOT complete your homework all in one shot & will NOT save. Attempting to master Data-structures and Algorithms requires constant exposure to these questions and solutions. You will create a PR through GitHub each night solving at minimum one problem which you were not able to solve during class time.

## What if the problem is too hard? Can't solve it in time?

1.  Spend 15-30 minutes trying to solve the problem if you are not able to, write and submit a
    program containing the following:

        As comments:

        - a description of the approach(es) you thought of
        - a description of where you got stuck on these approaches. For

    example: - Was there a flaw in the approach you found and you had to think
    of a new one? What was the flaw? How did you try to get around
    it? - Were you just unable to implement the approach? Which part(s)
    were you unable to implement, and why?

2.  If you get stuck reverse engineer the existing solution and take a few moments to digest it. (\*a few moments may take longer for leetcode hard)

    As code:

    - Type out the the program in your language by referencing the solution provided (2-3 times, No copy/pasting)
    - Reference leetcode discussion and reverse engineer a solution which fits most with your style.
      example:
      - If you seldom use higher order functions, then do not attempt to reverse engineer solutions which focus on these
      - If you prefer a certain implementation of a data-structure over another, please cater to your strengths

3.  Move on to the next problem.

    As a mindset:

    - Many will struggle with the common coding patterns for the first few times they encounter them, it is extremely important to learn how to move on with the intentions of revisiting said topic at a later date.
      example:
      - While we were young we would be assigned tasks like brushing our teeth, bathing, etc... Our parents would surely not allow us to "attempt" to brush our teeth for 90 minutes in pursuit of perfection at this stage in our lives, instead, they would likely step in and "take over" to ensure that we got it done. The emphasis was never on getting it perfect in one singular session, but, achieving muscle memory and improvement of motor skills through repition.
